<p>The first thing that comes to <strong>senior management</strong> point of view is that if it isn&rsquo;t the company&rsquo;s <strong>core competency</strong> cybersecurity doesn&rsquo;t come <strong>first</strong>. There is no argue here. If your company is in charge of distribution of goods, your key competitive advantage will not be security and that you excel at security, it&rsquo;s going to be distribution of goods. <strong>PERIOD</strong>. This has been seen across multiple sectors and areas worldwide. The company is satisfied with the <strong>average</strong> or <strong>compliant</strong> status to security standards. Let&rsquo;s face it, no one has time to constantly invest in cybersecurity and make it a top priority, even if it should be.</p>
