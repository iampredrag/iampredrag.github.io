            <description>I am not that great at maintaining blogs, but I will try to do a better job with this attempt. I&amp;rsquo;m Predrag and welcome to my new blog. I will focus here mostly on cloud and security topics I get to deal on a daily basis, whether it is my research, fun or some work related stuff (of course without violating any NDA&amp;rsquo;s or confidentiality). On daily basis I work with Microsoft Cloud technologies as well as design, integrate and operate various security solutions.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am not that great at maintaining blogs, but I will try to do a better job with this attempt. I&rsquo;m Predrag and welcome to my new blog. I will focus here mostly on cloud and security topics I get to deal on a daily basis, whether it is my research, fun or some work related stuff <em>(of course without violating any NDA&rsquo;s or confidentiality)</em>. On daily basis I work with Microsoft Cloud technologies as well as design, integrate and operate various security solutions. Most of my time I spend <strong>debugging</strong> or <strong>writing</strong> code to automate most of my work and further improving my skills.</p>
<p>I have spent a good decade of my life in Middle East (Qatar, Turkey, Saudi, UAE) and Asia (Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong) and now I am back in Europe (Vienna) where I work and live. All the views and statements in this blog are my own, and represent only my view or opinion on various matters.</p>
<p>I have some sort of passion, that is being nerdy and geeky when it comes to technology. I am obsessed with the <strong>bleeding cutting edge</strong> technology and I always play around with it. Here I will try to document various experiments I&rsquo;ve done and maybe, one day it will be useful for someone.</p>
